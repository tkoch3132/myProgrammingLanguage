# myProgrammingLanguage
I created this C program by myself for a C programming course so, I can understand how a computer works on a low level.

($> means type this, on the right into the terminal.)
To compile then execute this file:
1.Open a unix terminal.
2. type $>gcc main.c
3. then $>./a.out prog1 (prog2 and prog3 also exist)
4. type numbers(and numbers only!)
5. read the attached project description/guidelines.
