# myProgrammingLanguage

THIS PROGRAM WAS NOT MY IDEA, AND IT IS FROM A COURSE I TOOK AT UNO.
THIS CODE IS MEANT TO BE A REFERENCE FOR PEOPLE WORKING ON SIMILAR
ACADEMIC PROJECTS. NO CODE SHOULD BE COPIED AND GRADED AS SOMEONE ELSES WORK.

The program is esstionally a compiler for a made primitive-like programming language.
There is a project guideline file from the class that this was a requirement for.

($> means type this, on the right into the terminal.)
To compile then execute this file:
1.Open a unix terminal.
2. type $>gcc main.c
3. then $>./a.out prog1 (prog2 and prog3 also exist)
4. type numbers(and numbers only!)
5. read the attached project description/guidelines.

I created prog1, prog2 and prog3.
Each does the  following:

prog1 ­ Write a program that uses a counter controlled loop to read in positive and negative values and
output their sum. The first piece of data entered will be how many numbers are going to be summed.

prog2 ­ Write a program that uses a sentinel controlled loop to read in only non-negative numbers (a
negative value will end the loop, make sure this value is not part of the computation) and outputs the
average, do not worry about catching a divide by zero, this should give a runtime error.

prog3 ­ Write a program that reads in two numbers and if the second number is a multiple of the first
outputs the string "MULT" otherwise outputs the string "NOT"
